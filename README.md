Technologies Used in the 2048 Project
1. HTML
    The game structure is built using HTML5. Key elements include:
      <table> — A 4x4 game board
      <button> — A start button
      <p> — Messages displaying game status
2. SCSS (CSS Preprocessor)
    The game’s styling is implemented with SCSS, allowing for:
      Variables for colors and sizes
      Nesting for cleaner and more structured styles
      Easier maintenance and scalability
3. JavaScript (ES6+)
    The game logic is developed using JavaScript (ECMAScript 6+), featuring:
      Modular approach — main.js is imported using type="module"
      DOM manipulation to update the game board, score, and messages
      Event handling (keydown, click) for game interactions
      Tile movement and merging logic based on 2048 rules

This project demonstrates frontend development skills and the ability to build interactive web applications.
